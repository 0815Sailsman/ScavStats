# ScavStats

A WIP data-tracker for the game Scavengers by Midwinter.

The goal is to track virtually every possible data from just screencapturing. E.g. pathing during game, kills, weapons cause of deaths and much more
This data will then be used to build a live feedback app, that can recommend the best actions based on the data of previous games.
